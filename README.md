# Google Play Fraud Detection & Explanation

This repository contains an end-to-end pipeline for detecting fraudulent apps on the Google Play Store. The project uses a combination of rule-based labeling, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for supervised classification, and a Gemini API for cross-verification and explanation. The final output is generated by combining the ANN's preliminary prediction with a Gemini-generated explanation in a strict JSON format.

> **Final Output JSON Format:**  
> ```json
> { "type": "fraud"|"genuine"|"suspected", "reason": "Concise explanation (300 char max)" }
> ```

## Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Data Preprocessing & EDA:**  
   - Clean and transform raw Google Play data.
   - Handle missing values and convert string-based numeric columns (e.g., "Installs", "Maximum Installs") to numeric.
   - Encode categorical fields (e.g., "Editors Choice" and "Developer ID").  
   - Retain reference columns like "App Name" and "Category" for cross-verification and further analysis.

2. **Feature Engineering & Rule-Based Labeling:**  
   - Create a supervised target based on domain logic:
     - If an app is marked as Editor’s Choice (value = 1), mark it as genuine (0).
     - Else, if the app is not Editor’s Choice and its "Rating Count" is greater than its "Maximum Installs", mark it as fraud (1).
   - The target is encoded as **0 for genuine** and **1 for fraud**.

3. **ANN Model Training:**  
   - Train an ANN (using TensorFlow/Keras) on key features: `Rating`, `Rating Count`, `Installs`, `Maximum Installs`, and `Editor Choice` (with optional encoded `Developer ID` and `Category`).
   - Evaluate the model using cross-validation and save the trained model (`ann_model.h5`).

4. **Streamlit Web App & Gemini API:**  
   - A Streamlit app provides an interactive interface for predictions.
   - The app accepts input for the five feature columns along with "App Name" (for cross-verification).
   - The ANN model produces a preliminary prediction (fraud, genuine, or suspected).
   - The app then sends a prompt (including all details) to the Gemini API. Gemini returns a concise explanation in JSON format:
     ```json
     { "type": "fraud"|"genuine"|"suspected", "reason": "Concise explanation (300 char max)" }
     ```
   - The Gemini output is considered the final output.
